    The first interactive visualization is a scatter plot that shows the danceability of a song versus the tempo of a song. You also have the functionality to select different users to only view their songsâ€™ danceability and tempo levels. In addition, there is a tooltip accessed by hovering over a data point that will show the song name, artist, tempo, danceability, and user for any user. Key insights generated from this are that Mimi listens to the most danceable music while Justin listens to the least danceable music, and Arielle lies in between. Finally, there is no found correlation between tempo and danceability, unlike originally hypothesized.

    For the second interactive visualization, the scatter plot shows liveliness of a song versus the acousticness of a song. You can select different users to only view their comparison in songs, and you can also brush on top of the graph to create a focus area on the bottom of the graph that will show the danceability versus the acousticness of the song. In addition, on the bottom there is a tooltip accessed by hovering over a data point that will show the song name, artist, tempo, danceability, and user for any user. Finally, the main takeaways from this visualization are that Justin does not listen to much acoustic music, and that although there is no strong trend found between liveliness and acousticness, livelier music tends to be less acoustic. Lastly, despite listening to the least amount of genres, Justin still has the highest range of liveliness, showing there is diversity even within genres.
