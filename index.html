        Musical preferences have long been linked to individual characteristics, offering glimpses into one's identity. It supposedly tells you more than just what someone enjoys, but who they are. According to research by Audrey LaPlante from the University of Montreal, “music preferences can also act as a social badge that indicates membership in a social group or a social class” (LaPlante). A study involving 566 Dutch adolescents revealed a significant overlap in music preferences among mutual friends. Subsequent examination of these participants a year later showed that shared musical tastes facilitated the formation of new friendships, particularly when those tastes deviated from the mainstream (LaPlante).Armed with this insight, it promises to be illuminating to pursue our tasks of uncovering similarities and disparities in our musical tastes as three students within the same age bracket. While two of us hail from the same state, each of us also moves within our own social circles, making the exploration of commonalities and distinctions particularly intriguing.

       <br><br> This interactive Altair bar plot shows the overall levels for each category, split by project group members. The end user can cycle through which category they want displayed (energy, danceability, etc.), and the chart will accompany that change, showing the levels for each group member. This is a great in-depth representation of each Spotify user’s music taste in numerical format, and while being simple and pleasing to look at, still delivers major insights comparing and contrasting different measurements of their music taste. Some takeaways from this visualization are that in addition to the previously derived insights, Justin has the most “speechy” music taste, Mimi has the most instrumental music taste, Justin has the highest song tempo, and through many categories, Mimi and Arielle shared similar levels.
